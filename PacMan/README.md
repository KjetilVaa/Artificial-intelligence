# Pac Man

Pac man will search for the best possible move everytime using the algorithms mentioned below. It will only work if every agent in the game always plays its best.
I  will implement the Minimax algorithm for adversarial search. Afterwards I will extend my Minimax implementation to
use alpha-beta pruning, in order to speed up the search.
For this project I will follow the “Pac-Man projects” developed at UC Berkeley. The Pac-Man projects
were developed for UC Berkeley’s intro course to AI, and later made available for other universities to use.
See http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html for an overview of these projects. The projects
cover a variety of AI techniques, exploring them through the world of Pac-Man.
UC Berkeley has developed an extensive Python codebase to support these projects. This Python codebase
provides the framework in which I will write my Minimax and alpha-beta implementation.
