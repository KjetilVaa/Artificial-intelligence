# Soduko Solver
In this project I will implement a general solver for Constraint Satisfaction Problems, specifically using backtracking search and the arc-consistency algorithm AC-3.

I will then use this program to solve soduko boards with varying difficulty!

## Levels
By default the program will run in easy mode. To change level open the desired level.txt in the main.py.
